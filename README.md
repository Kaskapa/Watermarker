# Watermarker
A simple browser-based tool to watermark images — with custom text or image overlays.

## What is this?
Watermarker is a lightweight web app that lets users add a watermark to an image:
- As text (customizable size, color, position)
- Or as an image overlay (e.g. logo)
- With options to preview and download the final result

All done client-side — no backend, no uploads.

## Why I made it?
This was built as a 2-day solo project for a coding competition called "IT Eksāmens", where it placed 4th overall.
The goal: create a useful, no-nonsense tool quickly — focusing on usability, clean UI, and instant functionality.
## Features
- Upload an image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Add text watermark — set size, color, opacity, and placement
- Add image watermark — upload a second image as overlay
- Drag & position watermark freely
- Export/download final image
- Runs 100% in-browser — no server, no data sent

## Status
- Stable and functional
- Light and dependency-free
- Not actively maintained

## Competition

- Awarded 4th place overall
- Timeframe: ~2 days
